## ðŸŽ¯ Business Requirement
Goal: analyze Blinkit-style sales, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution to find opportunities for optimization using KPIs and interactive visuals in Power BI.

**KPI Requirements**
- **Total Sales** â€“ revenue from all items sold  
- **Average Sales** â€“ average revenue per sale  
- **Number of Items** â€“ total count of items sold  
- **Average Rating** â€“ average customer rating

**Chart Requirements (what I built)**
1. **Total Sales by Fat Content** â†’ Donut  
2. **Total Sales by Item Type** â†’ Bar  
3. **Fat Content by Outlet (Total Sales)** â†’ Stacked Column  
4. **Total Sales by Outlet Establishment (year)** â†’ Line  
5. **Sales by Outlet Size** â†’ Donut/Pie  
6. **Sales by Outlet Location (Tier)** â†’ Bar/Funnel style card  
7. **All KPIs by Outlet Type** â†’ Matrix (No. of items, Avg Rating, Avg Sales, Total Sales)

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights (sample from this dataset)
- **Tier-3** contributes the highest sales; **Medium** outlets lead (~$205K).
- **Top 3 item types â‰ˆ ~60% of sales** â†’ focus assortment & promos there.
- Avg rating holds around **~3.9**; consider quality initiatives for low-rated items.

> Numbers are from the sample dataset used in the `.pbix`; replace with your data as needed.

## ðŸ§® Core DAX (highlights)
- `Total Sales`, `Avg Sales`, `No of Items`, `Avg Rating`
- Time-intel: `Sales PY`, `YoY %`, `Sales PM`, `MoM %`
- Dynamic page `Title` reflecting slicers (Tier, Size, Item Type)
